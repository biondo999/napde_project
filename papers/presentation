slide1:
PINNs use automatic differentation to selve PDE by intrucing a loss at rondom points of interest to learn an inout output map,
the VIPPINs on the other hand introduce the weak formulation of our PDE for the loss calculation
and we pick as test functions Legendre polynomials
slide 2:
discrete loss explanation
slide 3:
PRO/CONS of VPINNs,PRO of IVINNIns 
slide 4:
training describtion supervised/unsupervised learning 
slide 5: goals
->make training depend on tollereance of error 
->make order of nodes for numericl integrarion depend on the regularity of the solution 
->implement training for different domains
